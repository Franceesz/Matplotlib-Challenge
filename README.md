# Matplotlib-Challenge
## Overview
In a laboratory study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this project was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. I then generated all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study as well as provided a top-level summary of the study results.
